Learnings (Week 1)


* We started off discussing the project - Support Analytics
* The process: Collect Data → Clean Data → Transform (extracting or keeping only the data we require) → Visualising (Power BI)
* Analyzing the tickets with the help of both Python (cleaning and transforming) and Power BI (visualisation)
* Extraction of data from database but instead we use SQL, CSV, Excel.
* Database: An organised collection of structured data stored for management, retrieval, updation and control. 


Task Given: Collect IT Ticketing Data for analysing.


* Clean Data via Power Query
   * Reports are static
   * Dashboards are dynamic
* Most cases a line chart is used to visualise time series data.
