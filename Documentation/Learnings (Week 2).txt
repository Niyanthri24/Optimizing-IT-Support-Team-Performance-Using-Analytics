Learnings (Week 2)


* Key difference between Python and Power BI
   * Power BI: Simple and not-real time.
   * Python: Reusable, ETL pipeline, automation.
* In very rare cases, there will be a need to make assumptions about the data.
* Phone Number data type would be a text. Suppose the number starts with ‘0’, it will be removed if it's an integer.
* Cleaning in VS Code will use jupyter notebook extension.




Definitions:
* Libraries: Pre-written codes or functions that help perform common tasks.
* Dataframe: tabular format where the data is arranged in rows and columns with named axes.
* Indices: They are from ‘0’ to ‘n’
* Nan: Empty
* N/a: null values
* Drop_duplicates OR drop.columns: to remove unwanted columns and duplicates
* Strip: remove special characters
* Standardisation of Y/N, Yes/No
