Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


4 steps for data analysis - 
1. Transform and clean
   1. Volume of the data and its structure
   2. How much data?
   3. Number of rows and columns?
   4. Categories
   5. Where is the data from?
   6. Understand the data.
2. Outliers 
   1. Remove or solve the outliers
3. Compare the data
4. Relationships




Netflix Data:
1. Is the platform more focused on 'TV Shows' or 'Movies'? (TV shows tend to keep subscribers retained for months, whereas movies are more viewed once - Retention Strategy)
2. Where is the content from? OR Which international market is the platform penetrating? (Where is the growth other than the US?)
3. How soon is the content reaching the streaming platform? (The changing audience habit has led to people watching movies/shows at home rather than in theatres. Are they catering to this need?)
4. What are the most common genres, and how do they compare to the top genres in countries where growth is expected?
5. Does the content match the target audience?  (Eg. If the goal is to sell a 'Family Plan' are the content justifying it or against it?)


Split the visualisation into two dashboards - 
1. What do they offer and where is it growing or selling?
2. The type of content and audience
