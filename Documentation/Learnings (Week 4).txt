Importing Live Data into Power BI


Get data from the Web: Certain websites allow for the data to be imported from the site, but certain websites don't allow importing data due to a few constraints - 
* Authentication or login requirements
* JSON content
* Firewall protection
* Unstructured data


Zendesk - 
* CRM organisation system
* Data management
* Requires an organisation account
* Used to create an API endpoint


Get data: WEB
* Paste link
* Basic
* Username: mail id | Password: API key


For real-time or changing data - Extract, Transform and Load (ETL Pipeline) 


Note: Zendesk cannot be used, as it is difficult to enter a lot of data manually. This can be a tedious task which will require a lot of manual hours to enter data.
