# Optimizing-IT-Support-Team-Performance-Using-Analytics

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyse IT support ticket data to identify key performance trends, optimise resolution times, and enhance service efficiency through data analysis and visualisation. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer requests, technical issues, and support performance metrics to recommend improvements in workflow and resource allocation.

## Dataset Description
Dataset: Customer Support Ticket Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Scale: 8000+ rows and 17 columns
Dataset Description: The dataset includes customer support tickets for various tech products. It consists of customer inquiries related to hardware issues, software bugs, network problems, account access, data loss, and other support topics. The dataset provides information about the customer, the product purchased, the ticket type, the ticket channel, the ticket status, and other relevant details.
Feature Description: 
- Ticket ID: A unique identifier for each ticket.
- Ticket Type: The type of ticket (e.g., technical issue, billing inquiry, product inquiry).
- Ticket Subject: The subject/topic of the ticket.
- Resolution: The resolution or solution provided for closed tickets.
- Ticket Priority: The priority level assigned to the ticket (e.g., low, medium, high, critical).
- First Response Time: The time taken to provide the first response to the customer.
- Time to Resolution: The time taken to resolve the ticket.
- Customer Satisfaction Rating: The customer's satisfaction rating for closed tickets (on a scale of 1 to 5).

## KPI Metrics
- Ticket Type: Essential for grouping issues
- Ticket Priority: Crucial for analysing high-urgency issues
- Resolution time: Helps measure support efficiency
- Customer Satisfaction Rating: To measure service quality
